    Problem spec: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at4T4n4JYNc
        Alice traveled by bike at an average speed of X miles per hour.
        Then, she traveled by train at an average speed of Y miles per hour.
        In total, she traveled D miles for T hours.
        
        Constraints:
            X --> [11, 20] mph
            Y --> [41, 50] mph
            avg rate --> [31, 40] mph
            T --> [1, 10] hours
        
        For how many miles did Alice travel by bike?
        For how many miles did Alice travel by train?
        For how many minutes did Alice travel by bike?
        For how many minutes did Alice travel by train?
        
        For fun, bike and train are randomly replaced by a few other vehicles.
