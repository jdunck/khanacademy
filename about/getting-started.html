        If you're a student, and over the age of 13, you can use the Google or Facebook account you already have to <a href="/login">sign in and get 
        started right now</a>. Signing in gives you the ability to track your own progress and earn points and badges.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't have an account with either of those sites, you can sign up for a 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount">Google</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/r.php">Facebook</a> account to get started.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are under 13, you are going to need to get your parents to create an account for you first, sorry!
    </p>
    <div class="clear"></div>
    <a name="teachers"><h2>I'm a teacher, coach, or parent, how do I start using the site with my student(s)?</h2></a>
    <p>
        First things first: you need an account, and you need to be signed in on the Khan Academy. So, <a href="/login">sign in or sign up</a>.
        Once you've got an account you can actually start getting students to add you as their coach.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next step is: every student that you want to coach needs an account as well. Students over 13 can sign up for 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount">Google</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/r.php">Facebook</a> accounts immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your students are under 13, this part is a little trickier because <a href="http://www.coppa.org/">COPPA regulations</a> won't allow us to 
        collect any personal information from students under 13. Instead, you must have their parents create accounts for them on either 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount">Google</a> or Facebook</a>. We are constantly
        working to improve this situation, but that's the best we've got at the moment (sorry!).
    </p>
    <p>
        Once this is done, each student will need to identify you as their coach. There are detailed instructions and screenshots on the 
        <a href="/class_profile">Coach page</a> or <a href="#teachers" onclick="$('#empty-class-container').slideDown('fast');">you can find them here</a>.

        First, we're really thankful for your interest in the Khan Academy and implementing it in your school.  We are in the process of evaluating to 
        what extent we can support additional pilot implementations.  We aren't ready just yet, but would recommend the following:

        <li>
            Read and learn more about what we are doing in Los Altos. Everything they are using is free for any school to use. <br/><br/>

        <li>
            Let us know what you are doing with the Khan Academy, by <a href="mailto:ssinha@khanacademy.org">emailing us</a>.  If we get more resources 
            to be more actively engaged, we'll reach out to you shortly.  We enjoy visiting classrooms and getting feedback from teachers.  However, 
            since we only have 6 people (most of whom are creating content) we have limited resources to interact directly with schools.  At some point, 
            we will make more resources available on our website, and potentially even ask schools like yourself to share your experiences with others.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        We are moving fast, so we expect a lot to happen by next school year!  We'd love to see you all involved in our next big wave.
