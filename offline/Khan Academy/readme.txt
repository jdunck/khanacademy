Here's a first version of the Khan Academy website for offline use.
http://code.google.com/p/khanacademy/downloads/list

Unzip it and click on run.bat, which will start up the server and load the local version of the 
Khan Academy homepage in your browser.  

Next go to the download_scripts directory, and click on the playlist that you want to download.
Once the script is complete, the videos in that playlist will work when you click on them in the 
browser.
