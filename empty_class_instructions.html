            <p>Then, they should enter your Coach ID in the form that looks like this:</p>
            <div class="coach-email">{{ coach_email|escape }}</div>
            <a href="/coaches"><img src="/images/enter-coach-email.png?{{App.version}}" class="vertical-shadow rounded-background"/></a>
            <p>
                Your Coach ID is <strong>{{ coach_email|escape }}</strong>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="click-register">
            <p>Finally, they need to click the <em>Register Coach</em> button. It looks like this:</p>
